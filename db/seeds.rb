# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# phish = Artist.create(name: "Phish", bio: "from Vermont")
# hold = Artist.create(name: "The Hold Steasdy", bio: "Stay Positive")

# pop = Genre.create(name: "POP")
# rock = Genre.create(name: "ROCK")
# jam = Genre.create(name: "JAM")
